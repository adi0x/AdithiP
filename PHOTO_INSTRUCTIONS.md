# How to Add Your Photo to the Portfolio

## Option 1: Save Photo as File (Recommended)

1. **Save your photo** as `adithi-photo.jpg` in this folder (`/Users/adithik/Desktop/Profile`)
2. **Update the HTML** by changing this line in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Change this line in the profile-avatar section -->
<img src="adithi-photo.jpg" alt="Adithi Koppula" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%; border: 3px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);">
```

## Option 2: Use Online Image URL

If you upload your photo to a service like:
- Google Drive (make it public)
- Dropbox (get shareable link)
- Imgur
- Any image hosting service

Then update the `src` attribute with your image URL.

## Option 3: I Can Help Convert to Base64

If you'd like me to convert your photo to base64 and embed it directly in the HTML, just let me know!
